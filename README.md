This project acts similar to classifieds-style websites where users can post items for sale, job offers, and missed connections. The site features dynamic JavaScript, jQuery, AJAX, mobile compatibility, and accessibility features. Additionally, I implemented session storage since there is no database currently attached to store posts. The site has an alien theme.

My client was Shyanne Temple, who came up with the initial idea for the website as well as the alien theme.
